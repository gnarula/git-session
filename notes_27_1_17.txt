git clone
	Clones a repo from github onto your local system
git status
	To view the untracked files and folders in the repository
git reset HEAD~1
	Moves repo back to the previous commit made
git-remote -v
	Lists the remotes linked to the repository


Files ending with ~ are made by the text editor and will generally cease to exist as soon as the editor is closed

This is a trial for rebasing.
git rebase -i
	i is for interactive rebasing
	rebasing-squashing is merging two commits into one commit
	
The commit log can be visualized as a linked list of commits
The latest git commit is called the HEAD
The second last commit is HEAD~1
Another trial
